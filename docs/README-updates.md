## ðŸ¤– Protocol Update Notice

This repository has adopted the [`ai-handshake`](https://github.com/sanket-chaudhari/ai-handshake) protocol (v1.1.0) as of May 2025.

All AI-human collaboration is now structured around:

- **Milestones** and explicit build steps
- **Modular Code Payloads (MCPs)** for file updates
- **Agent-readable configuration** via `.agentrc.json`
- **Folder-level READMEs and changelogs** for traceability

This protocol improves clarity, reviewability, and long-term maintainability of the codebase. You can find the full context in `docs/handshake-context.md`.
