# MCP Agent Overview (Planned GitHub Integration)

This document outlines the role of the MCP agent pattern used in this repository, and how future GitHub integration may evolve.

## ðŸ§© What is an MCP?

MCP stands for **Modular Code Payload** â€” a structured input/output format used to:

- Define code changes cleanly
- Track them as atomic commit units
- Enable safe execution by human developers or trusted agents

Each MCP has:
```json
{
  "files": [{ "path": "...", "content": "..." }],
  "commitMessage": "..."
}
```

## ðŸš€ Future Integration Plan

This project plans to evolve to include:

- GitHub-based MCP agents
- PR scaffolding automation
- Versioned snapshot pipelines
- Changelog generation from MCP commit summaries

---

## ðŸ§ª Current Usage

MCPs are executed manually by pasting into a local MCP agent (`input.json`) and running a file writer. This ensures controlled edits and allows review before commit.
