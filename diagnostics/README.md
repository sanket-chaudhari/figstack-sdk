# Diagnostics Folder

This folder stores diagnostic reports, test results, and runtime logs generated by plugins, services, or CLI tools.

Each file in this directory is intended to provide **visibility into the health and correctness** of the local setup or plugin/service execution context.

---

## 📁 Folder Purpose

- Store `.txt` or `.log` reports from `runDiagnostic()`
- Debug failures related to `.env`, scope resolution, or API mismatches
- Maintain scoped logs per plugin or service folder

---

## 🧱 Design Guidelines

- Reports must be timestamped and named clearly (e.g. `diag--<timestamp>.txt`)
- Do not version control this folder; it is local and ephemeral
- One diagnostic file per invocation is preferred over appending to shared files

---

## 🧪 Usage Example

When a plugin or service runs a diagnostic:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-env.ts
```

…this folder will contain:

```
diagnostics/
├── diag--2025-05-11T08:34.txt
```

---

## 🛡️ Git Hygiene

This folder is excluded by default in `.gitignore`.

If needed for shared inspection, copy reports into a versioned location manually.

---

## ✅ Summary

The `diagnostics/` folder acts as a local dropzone for runtime feedback. It is purely optional and disposable — used to improve reliability and speed up debugging.
